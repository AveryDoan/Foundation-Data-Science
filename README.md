Welcome to our group project for **HIT140: Foundations of Data Science**. In this project, we act as data detectives to support zoologists investigating the interactions between bats and rats at a shared food platform.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

We aim to answer two key scientific investigations using real-world surveillance data:

### 🔍 Investigations
- **Investigation A**: Do bats perceive rats as competitors or predators?  
- **Investigation B**: How do bat-rat interactions change across seasons?

---

## 🗂️ Datasets Used

1. **dataset1.csv** – Observations of individual bat landings and behaviour  
2. **dataset2.csv** – Summary of 30-minute periods showing bat and rat activity

## 🧭 Project Timeline & Tasks

### 🔹 Phase 1: Setup and Planning (Week 1)
- Understand project objectives
- Assign team roles (Analyst, Cleaner, Visualizer, Presenter, Writer)
- Create shared workspace (Google Drive / GitHub)
- Download datasets from Learnline

### 🔹 Phase 2: Data Exploration & Cleaning (Week 2)
- Inspect data types, missing values, and outliers
- Clean and preprocess data ethically
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Create summary stats and graphs

### 🔹 Phase 3: Investigation A – Bat Perception of Rats (Week 3–4)
- Feature engineering: Rat presence, response time, risk-taking
- Descriptive stats: Behaviour with vs without rats
- Inferential analysis: t-tests, chi-square tests
- Visualizations: Boxplots, bar graphs, timelines
- Deliverable: Team video presentation (Assessment 2)

### 🔹 Phase 4: Investigation B – Seasonal Behaviour Changes (Week 5–6)
- Filter datasets by `season` and `month`
- Analyze seasonal trends in bat and rat activity
- Compare behaviour across winter vs spring
- Optional: incorporate external environmental data
- Deliverable: Analytical content for group report (Assessment 3)

### 🔹 Phase 5: Group Report Writing (Week 6–7)
- Structure the report:
  - Introduction
  - Methodology
  - Results
  - Discussion
  - Conclusion
  - References (APA style)
  - AI tools usage declaration
- Peer review & editing

### 🔹 Phase 6: Final Submission (Week 8)
- Review Learnline instructions
- Final polish and formatting
- Submit report and forms on time

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy.stats`, `statsmodels`
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis
- GitHub / Google Drive for collaboration
- PowerPoint + OBS/Zoom for presentation

---

## 📎 Notes

- Ethical analysis is required — no altering of original data values to suit desired outcomes.
- Feature engineering is encouraged.
- Expect real-world “dirty” data: missing, inconsistent, and irregular values.
